Okay, here we go!
I'm thinking for a while now to start blogging. But whenever I ended up thinking about the topics I want to write about I stopped, thinking it will just be something what you can find on at least 100 other places on the web. 

But hey, why I want to blog? 

I recently did a big change in my professional life. I jumped into the the IT world. Why? I will write about this for sure in another blog entry, but let's go back to why and what I want to blog about. As I don't come from a computer science background and just recently changed I still have so many things to learn and as exciting as this is, sometimes it just feels I'm not learning fast enough. 

So I thought I will just document my learnings at this blog. Mainly to see for myself, where I'm going and as well it might be interesting for people, who are in a similar situation than me. 

Let's see where this goes :)
