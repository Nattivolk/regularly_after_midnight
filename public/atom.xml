    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Okay, here we go!
I&rsquo;m thinking for a while now to start blogging. But whenever I ended up thinking about the topics I want to write about I stopped, thinking it will just be something what you can find on at least 100 other places on the web.</p>

<p>But hey, why I want to blog?</p>

<p>I recently did a big change in my professional life. I jumped into the the IT world. Why? I will write about this for sure in another blog entry, but let&rsquo;s go back to why and what I want to blog about. As I don&rsquo;t come from a computer science background and just recently changed I still have so many things to learn and as exciting as this is, sometimes it just feels I&rsquo;m not learning fast enough.</p>

<p>So I thought I will just document my learnings at this blog. Mainly to see for myself, where I&rsquo;m going and as well it might be interesting for people, who are in a similar situation than me.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see where this goes :)</p>
