One thing I always missed after reading some blog posts was a little challenge to try out. 
Of course I play around with commands I've just learnt and I totally recommend this to everyone, but solving something is always a nice way of making me think. So this post is related to the "Command Line Basics" from two days ago.

Some exercises to try out:

<ul>
<li>Download a file and change it to your new directory a) with b) without keeping the file in your Download folder</li>
 
<li>Create a new directory inside your directory and try to delete it (the whole command can't be found in the last post. Have a look at man, google or write a command, if you can't solve it)</li>

<li>Create a new file inside your directory and see, what rights your user has. Try to remove the write permission </li>

<li>List all your previous commands, which used <code>cd</code>
</li>
</ul>
